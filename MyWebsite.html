					<h3>ROBLOX Developer</h3>
					
					<p>My first ever project on ROBLOX was made back in 2020. It was a classic fighting game where people would fight and whoever came out on top wins! This game was unfortunately non-functional after a few updates from ROBLOX and discouraged me to bring it back. It is no longer available and peaked at 11.4k visits. Link to the game is below.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4837754232/Discontinued">First ROBLOX project</a></p>
					
					<p>A few years passed and learning new Programming Languages, I became motivated to come back into ROBLOX game development. My second overall project is in the works currently and it can be found in the link below. Short-Summary on what the game is about: It's an ability based class fighting game.</p>
